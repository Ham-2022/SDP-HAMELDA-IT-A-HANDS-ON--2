    <p id="healthParagraph3">“Being able to be your true self is one of the strongest components of good mental health.” Lauren Fogel Mersy, n.d. “All stress, anxiety, depression, is caused when we ignore who we are, and start living to please others.” To maintain wellbeing, individuals need to recognize their inner strengths.</p>

    <h1 id="healthDescription5">Have a cup of green tea</h1>
    <p id="healthParagraph5">

Take a slow sip, let the tea liquor linger in your mouth. Swish it over the tip and sides of your tongue, noticing the texture and weight of the tea in addition to the flavor.</p>
